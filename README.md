# Credit_Risk_Analysis
oversampling credit score data to evaluate credit risk performance via machine learning modules

## Overview

Jill was impressed with our work we provided early on in the module. Now, we are to apply machine learning to the real-world challenge of credit card risk. Jill asks us to utilize the imbalanced-learn and scikit_learn libraries to evaluate the credit risk models. In this particular issue of credit risk analysis, there is a disparity between the high risk and low risk loans. We will use two machine learning models to predict credit risk. The two machine learning models are BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

## Results

### RandomOverSampler Model


The balanced accuracy score is approximately 60.9%
